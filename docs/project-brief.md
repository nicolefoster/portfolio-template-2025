## Project Concept

### What are you building?

My project will be a personal portfolio website where I present my design work in a fun, creative, and approachable way. I want the experience to feel light and playful, using smooth transitions, scroll animations, and simple navigation to guide the viewer. The whole site will be built only with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep everything clean and easy to explore.

### Who is it for?

This project is for anyone who wants to explore my design work in a simple and engaging way. Especially teachers, potential clients, and other creatives. I want it to feel welcoming and easy to navigate, even for people who don’t usually look at portfolio websites.

### Why does it matter?

It matters because it gives me a space to present my work in a way that truly reflects my style: fun, creative, and approachable. A well-designed portfolio helps people understand how I think and what I can do, and it can open doors for future opportunities, collaborations, or clients. It’s also a way for me to practice building real digital experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

The visual style of my project is playful, minimal, and very clean. I will use soft colors, rounded shapes, and smooth animations to create a friendly and approachable feeling. Everything will be organized and balanced, so the layout feels creative without being overwhelming. This will be a a mix that reflects my personality and design approach.

### Color Palette

My color palette is based on soft, playful tones that feel friendly and approachable. The main colors are a warm off-white background (#FFFDE8), a deep periwinkle blue (#321EC5), and a few pastel accent colors like pinks, yellows, and light blues that appear in the project visuals. These colors help keep everything clean, fun, and visually consistent.

### Typography

For this project, I’m using Georgia, a classic serif typeface that feels elegant but still warm and approachable. I chose it because it adds a slightly editorial, creative look while keeping the text easy to read. Its serif style balances well with the playful shapes and animations in the design, giving the whole website a clean but expressive personality.
