# Navigation Menu: Plan & Change Log

## Overview

This document records the plan and the concrete changes made to the site's
navigation menu during the styling session. It captures the requests, the
implementation steps, and the final state so future edits are easy to track.

## Plan

1. Inspect the uploaded reference image (`assets/capturas/navigation menu.png`) and the existing navigation markup and CSS.
2. Add a responsive hamburger toggle to the HTML for mobile.
3. Tokenize and centralize colors in `assets/css/themes.css` (so global theme changes are simple).
4. Implement a centered, fixed navigation bar with the logo on the left and the nav pills centered.
5. Style each nav item as an individual rounded pill with a bright blue border and increased padding.
6. Make the site background warm beige and update the hero gradient to match the overall tone.
7. Ensure typography for headings uses the tokenized Georgia font and update body typography to use tokens.
8. Add a small JS toggle to open/close the mobile menu and close it on link click.
9. Iterate on colors and paddings per user feedback (change accent to `#2A24F5`, adjust hover tint).

## Change Log

Files changed (high level):

- `assets/css/themes.css` — color tokens updated to a warm beige background and blue accents; `--color-text` and `--color-accent` finally set to `#2A24F5`.
- `assets/css/navigation.css` — navigation centered, pill layout for each nav item, bright blue border for each pill, increased padding, hover tint, responsive hamburger styles.
- `assets/css/layout.css` — hero gradient changed to warm beige tones to match theme.
- `assets/css/base.css` — body typography updated to use tokenized `--font-family-base` and light weight.
- `index.html` — mobile nav toggle button added; project images were earlier temporarily swapped and then reverted.
- `assets/js/main.js` — mobile nav toggle logic added; observers/scroll logic preserved.

## User-driven iterations

- Replaced initial Georgia → Poppins → Georgia flow: typography tokens were created and the final choice was restored to Georgia with `--font-family-base`.
- The user asked to use captures as visual references; those were applied to hero and project cards, then reverted when the user requested rollback. Navigation edits remained as requested.
- Color theme: user asked for a beige site with blue text/accents. Tokens were updated so the change is global and reversible.

## Implementation Notes

- Colors and typography are tokenized in `assets/css/themes.css`. To change the entire look, update the tokens there.
- Navigation layout: `.nav` is fixed and centered; `.nav-logo` is absolutely positioned to the left inside `.nav-container` so the pill group remains visually centered.
- Each nav link is wrapped by an `li` pill. Pills use `border: 2px solid var(--color-accent)` and increased padding (`var(--space-md) var(--space-xl)`).
- Mobile behavior: hamburger button toggles `.nav-links.open` to scale the menu open; JS closes the menu on link click.
- Accessibility: skip link was preserved; JS respects `prefers-reduced-motion` logic already present in the project.

## How to revert or adjust

- To change the accent color globally, edit `--color-accent` in `assets/css/themes.css`.
- To switch pills from outline to filled (blue background with beige text), change `.nav-links li` to use `background: var(--color-accent); border: none;` and set `.nav-links a { color: var(--color-bg); }`.
- To reduce pill padding, edit the `padding` value in `.nav-links li` in `assets/css/navigation.css`.

## Status

- Navigation now matches the requested visual style: centered, fixed, rounded pills with a bright blue border (`#2A24F5`) on a warm beige background. Mobile toggle is implemented and responsive behavior is in-place.

If you want, I can now:

- Animate the hamburger to transform into an X when opened.
- Invert the pill colors (filled blue pills with beige text) for higher contrast.
- Add small accessibility improvements like `aria-controls` and focus trap when mobile menu is open.
