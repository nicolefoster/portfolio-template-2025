# Plan and Report: GitHub Repository Link in Footer

## Background

To improve accessibility and encourage visitors to explore the project source code, the user wanted to add a direct link to their GitHub repository in the website footer.

## User Request

The user requested a clear, easy-to-access link to their GitHub repository. The goal was to make it simple for anyone visiting the site to find and visit the project's GitHub page.

## Plan

- Add a GitHub icon (github-icon.png) to the footer, linking to the repository.
- Place the icon and a descriptive text ("Visit my GitHub repository.") together for clarity.
- Ensure both the icon and the text are clickable and styled consistently with the rest of the footer.
- Test the link to confirm it opens the correct GitHub page in a new tab.

## Implementation

- Updated the HTML to include a GitHub icon and the text beside it in the footer.
- Wrapped both the icon and the text in a single link for better usability.
- Styled the link and text to match the footer's look and feel.

## Result

The footer now features a prominent, easy-to-access link to the GitHub repository. Both the icon and the text are clickable, making it straightforward for users to visit the project on GitHub.

## Next Steps

- Monitor user feedback for further improvements.
- Consider adding links to other relevant profiles or resources if needed.
