# Plan and Report: Transparent Card for About Me Section

## Background

The About Me section originally displayed text directly on the page background, which made the content feel like it was floating and lacked visual structure.

## User Request

The user wanted to give the website more structure and prevent the text from feeling like it was just floating. The goal was to add a transparent card background to the About Me section, similar to the card used for the My Skills section, to create a more cohesive and visually organized layout.

## Plan

- Identify the About Me section in the HTML and the card style used in the My Skills section.
- Wrap the About Me text in a card container.
- Apply the same card styling (background, border radius, shadow, and color) as the My Skills card for consistency.
- Test the new design to ensure the About Me section feels structured and visually integrated.

## Implementation

- Updated the HTML to wrap the About Me text in a `.about-text-card` div.
- Modified the CSS to apply the same background, border radius, shadow, and color as the My Skills card.
- Ensured the card is centered and visually matches the style of other cards on the site.

## Result

The About Me section now features a transparent card background, giving the text a clear structure and preventing it from appearing to float on the page. This change improves the overall organization and professionalism of the website.

## Next Steps

- Review the About Me section on different devices for consistency.
- Apply similar card styling to other sections if needed for further visual structure.
