# Glassmorphism: Plan & Report

## Purpose

Record the plan and implementation details for adding a glassmorphism effect to the site's primary CTAs ("View My Work" and "Say Hello"). This file documents where the code was added, the behavior changes, fallbacks, and attribution.

---

## Plan

### Objective

Create a visually-modern glassmorphism style for the main CTAs so they read as frosted, translucent surfaces over the page gradient while preserving accessibility and graceful fallbacks.

### Goals

- Add a reusable CSS modifier class (`.btn--glass`) that implements the glass-card visual system (translucent background, `backdrop-filter: blur`, subtle highlights and shadows).
- Apply the modifier to the hero CTA (`View My Work`) and the contact CTA (`Say Hello`).
- Ensure hover/active states feel tactile and provide a reduced-motion fallback.
- Document the source of the generator code used and any attribution.

### Implementation steps

1. Create `.btn--glass` in `assets/css/components.css`, adapted from the provided `.glass-card` snippet and tuned for inline CTA usage (padding, min-width, ARIA-friendly visual states).
2. Add pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) to simulate sheen/highlights from the original snippet.
3. Update `index.html` so both CTA anchors include the `btn--glass` modifier.
4. Test visually and verify that on browsers without `backdrop-filter` the button remains usable (translucent fallback).
5. Document the change and attribute the generator used as the code source.

## Report — Changes Applied

Files changed

- `assets/css/components.css`

  - Added `.btn--glass` implementing glassmorphism adapted from the provided `glass-card` snippet.
  - Key properties: `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.35)`, `backdrop-filter: blur(13px)`, subtle inset highlights, outer shadow, and sheen pseudo-elements.

- `index.html`
  - Applied `class="btn btn--glass"` to both CTAs:
    - Hero: `View My Work`
    - Contact: `Say Hello`

What exactly was implemented

- A compact, reusable modifier `.btn--glass` for inline CTAs with:
  - Semi-opaque white surface to create separation from the gradient background
  - `backdrop-filter` blur to produce the frosted effect
  - Dual shadows and small inset highlights for perceived depth
  - `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to recreate subtle top and side sheens from the original snippet
  - Hover lift and pressed-in active styles
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` handling (transitions disabled when requested)

Attribution

- The glass effect design was implemented using code adapted from a generator the user found online. Per your request, this is recorded here: "Implementation adapted from code generated by an online glassmorphism generator (source: user-provided)." The author reviewed and integrated the output to fit the project's structure.

Fallbacks & Accessibility

- Browsers that do not support `backdrop-filter` will show the semi-transparent background without the blur; the buttons remain fully usable.
- Because the buttons use a light translucent surface over a colorful gradient, the button text uses `var(--color-text)` (a darker blue) to maintain legibility. If you change theme colors, re-run a contrast check (WCAG) for the button text.
- Motion: transitions respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Notes & Suggestions

- If you want a tinted glass option that leans toward the site's accent color, we can add a `btn--glass--tint` variant that uses a subtle tinted `rgba()` for the background and a slightly different border/box-shadow.
- If you want the buttons to match the glass surface across the site, consider extracting the glass values into tokens in `themes.css` for consistency.
- Consider providing a fallback solid border or slightly stronger shadow for older browsers that don't support backdrop filters.

Status

- Implementation: completed — `.btn--glass` exists and both CTAs use it.
- Documentation: completed — this plan/report records the implementation details and attribution.

---

If you'd like, I can now:

- add a `btn--glass--tint` variant that uses a subtle accent tint, OR
- extract glass surface values into theme tokens (`--glass-bg`, `--glass-border`, `--glass-blur`) and update the CSS to reference them.
