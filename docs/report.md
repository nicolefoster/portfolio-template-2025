# Report: Use of AI in my project

## Paso 1: Creating the base for my web

First, I uploaded some photos of my Figma designs to Claude to show how I wanted my website to look. These images served as a reference so Claude could generate suggestions and content related to the visual style I was aiming for.

### Command Sent to Claude

> "Use these Figma frames to create a clean and modern portfolio template in HTML and CSS. Make it fun, creative, and approachable. Include smooth transitions for hover effects, scroll-driven animations, and parallax scrolling for sections. Use the exact color palette I’ve specified: #321ec5 for primary elements, #fffde8 for the background, #ff69b4 for accents, and #d368a3 for highlights. Ensure the layout is fully responsive and easy to adapt for different screen sizes."
